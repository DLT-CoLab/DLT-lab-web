             <p class="text-left">On the 31st of October 2008, a paper titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a cryptography mailing list under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The paper detailed the foundations for a digital currency in which transactions could happen from anywhere in the world, by anyone, without the need for a central issuing authority or regulatory body.

Fast-forward to 2013 and Bitcoin’s value was flirting with the $1000 mark. Beneath the surface of the growing hype, people began to notice potential for improvement. One such person was Vitalik Buterin, a crypto-researcher and programmer, who described the need for a scripting language that would facilitate development of applications on a decentralised blockchain. The Ethereum Project launched in 2015 and would go on to represent an important milestone in DLT’s development timeline. Thanks to the ERC-20 standard, tokenisation of concepts became not only viable, but enticing to the bold entrepreneur.

Over the next couple of years, dozens of projects would be built onto blockchain platforms. Blockchain and DLT were considered by many to be one and the same. However, that mould was quietly broken in 2016 with the launch of IOTA and Tangle Network. Built specifically to support micro and nano-transactions in the looming Internet-Of-Things industry, the IOTA project described a new way of maintaining a distributed ledger. The Tangle brought a list of previously inconceivable benefits to the world of DLT. It was to be quantum proof, infinitely scalable and most notably, able to conduct free transactions.

From the early-days of Bitcoin, to the Ethereum crowd-sale, to the still-blooming IOTA Project - the nakamo.to team weren’t just aware of the surge of DLT, they were active participants in its growth. The team combine years of knowledge and experience in the cryptosphere which they’re now channelling into the natural next step for DLT - adoption of the Tangle Network. This revolutionary technology has the ability to disrupt the already disruptive world of DLT in ways people haven’t even thought of yet. It holds the potential to bring worlds of good, disrupting long-standing industries and creating new markets in the process.

The nakamo.to team has a track record of being one step ahead. Through meticulous research and seasoned foundations in DLT, we aim to use the huge potential of the Tangle Network as the bridge between the world of today and the DLT-based world of tomorrow - positioning ourselves at the forefront of the next cycle in this exciting revolution.</p>
